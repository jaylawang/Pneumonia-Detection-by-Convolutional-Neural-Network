# Pneumonia Detection with Convolutional Neural Network
Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, particularly affecting children, the elderly, and individuals with compromised immune systems. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to reduce the disease's severe outcomes and improve patient survival rates.  This study explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automate pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images, providing a scalable and efficient diagnostic solution.
## Dataset
The Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). The dataset contains about 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal).
