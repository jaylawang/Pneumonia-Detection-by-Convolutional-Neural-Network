# Pneumonia Detection with Convolutional Neural Network
-  Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide,
 particularly affecting children, the elderly, and individuals with compromised immune
 systems. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial to reduce the disease's severe
 outcomes and improve patient survival rates.  This study explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
 automate pneumonia detection from chest X-ray images, providing a scalable and
 efficient diagnostic solution.
